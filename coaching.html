  <h3 class="heading">Who am I?</h3>

  <p>
    My name is Brooke Larimer. I have been a professional singer, administrator, and entrepreneur in the field of classical music for over 20 years.
    <br><br>
		I am also the owner of an ADHD brain (diagnosed at the age of 26) and have been perpetually, maddeningly, stymied and frustrated by my own behaviors, thought patterns, and inconsistencies. in fact, <b>it seemed the only consistent thing about me was inconsistency.</b> (seriously, why could I memorize a 400-page opera score in a language i barely speak, but couldn't remember to get my clothes out of the dryer?)
		<br><br>
		I used to manage my life by leveraging workaholism, an overactive social calendar, and carefully cultivated terror. somehow I created the illusion of keeping all of my various plates spinning for decades. but when the pandemic hit, I was stripped of all of my questionable coping mechanisms and I found myself literally staring at my wall, paralyzed by boredom and dopamine-deprivation, and unable to take a step in any direction. everyone was struggling during that time but I was struggling...more...and differently.
		<br><bI>
		All the wall-staring sent me on a meandering journey of self-discovery that eventually delivered me to <a href="https://www.iactcenter.com/"> iACTCenter </a> where I began training as an ADHD coach; I complete this program in summer 2023.

  <h3 class="heading">What is coaching?</h3>

  <p>
    A coach is not a teacher.
    <br>
		A coach is not a guru.
		<br>
		A coach is not a mentor.
		<br>
		A coach is not a therapist.
  </p>
<hr>
 <p>
   <b>A good coach knows that no one can know you, your goals, your needs, or your values better than you do.</b><br>

through the process of coaching, a coach will help you, the client, identify your own goals, develop a deeper awareness of your own aptitudes and obstacles, and identify your own personal path forward.<br><br>

<b>Coaching is focused on your future, your strengths, and your solutions.</b><br>

I can help you find your own specialized, creative pathway to something new.<

<p>
ADHD coaching is designed to specifically address the peculiarities of living with an ADHD brain, but the practice of coaching can be applied to all brains. no diagnosis (or suspected diagnosis) required. inquire within.
